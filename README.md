# Scoresheet in Vanilla runs

A scoresheet from daily runs will now appear when you beat the major bosses (currently Isaac, Satan, The Lamb, ???/Blue Baby, Mega Satan is supported)

The goal is set randomly at the start of a new run, which can be changed in ImGui bar -> Scoresheet -> Settings window
